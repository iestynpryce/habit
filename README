habit - a command line utility to help you develop good habits!

It is based upon the idea of Habit Judo [0], which uses randomized rewards in order to help you build good habits. This is a very simple command line utility which takes a CSV file, where every row equates to one habit you're working on building.

Every time you've done a habit (go for a run, take out the bins, etc.) you're points for that habit are increased by a random number in the range [1,10]. Once you have 15 points you pass a gate and receive the reward attached to that habit. This allows you to get a new reward and add a new habit to build upon!

Usage:
	./habit me.habit
