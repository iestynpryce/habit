habit - a command line utility to help you develop good habits!

It is based upon the idea of Habit Judo [0], which uses randomized rewards in order to help you build good habits. This is a very simple Unix style command line utility.

Every time you've done a habit (go for a run, take out the bins, etc.) you're points for that habit are increased by a random number in the range [1,10]. Once you have 15 points you pass a gate and receive the reward attached to that habit. This allows you to get a new reward and add a new habit to build upon!

USAGE: ./habit [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:

    -a <habit> <reward>     Add a new habit with a reward
    -d <id>                 Delete habit <id>
    -l                      List all habits (default when no options are given)
    -r <id>                 Record that habit with <id> has been done
    -u <id> <reward>        Update habit <id> with a new reward <reward>
    -h                      This usage message
